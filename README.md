Welcome to the Interactive Chess Game built with Python! 🐍 This is a fun, terminal-based chess game where two players can play a game of chess, interactively and efficiently, right in your command line.

Whether you’re a chess enthusiast or a Python lover, this project is a great way to combine both! 🎮🧠
